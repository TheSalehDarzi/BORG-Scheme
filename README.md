## 🧠 Abstract

Current 5G networks lack robust base-station authentication during bootstrapping, leaving them vulnerable to **fake BS**, **key compromise**, and **quantum-era forgeries**.  
Integrating NIST-PQC algorithms directly into 5G protocols is impractical due to **packet size**, **latency**, and **fragmentation constraints**.

**BORG** introduces a **Hierarchical Identity-Based Threshold Signature** with a **Fail-Stop (FS) property**, offering a *transitional*, distributed, and post-quantum-aware authentication mechanism for 5G and beyond.

> 🧩 BORG achieves distributed trust, forgery accountability, and post-mortem quantum attack detection — all within native 5G constraints.

---

## 🌐 Overview

**BORG** serves as an **intermediate step** toward full PQC migration in 5G networks by providing:

✅ **Hierarchical Identity-Based Trust** — eliminates certificate chains  
✅ **Threshold Signing (t, n)** — distributed base-station cooperation  
✅ **Fail-Stop Security** — provable post-mortem PQ forgery detection  
✅ **Audit Logging** — PQ-secure threshold-signed logs for accountability  
✅ **Real 5G Integration** — implemented on **srsRAN** with **open5GS**

---

## 🔬 Implementation Layers

BORG includes two main implementations:

1️⃣ **Cryptographic Core** — Implements the Hierarchical Identity-Based Threshold Fail-Stop Signature (HITFS) and PQ threshold audit logging.  
2️⃣ **5G Testbed Integration** — Realistic deployment using srsRAN and open5GS for BS–UE bootstrapping and signature verification.

## ⚙️ System Requirements

### 🖥️ Hardware

BORG was tested on an SDR-based 5G testbed:

- **CPU:** Intel Core i9-11900K @ 3.50 GHz  
- **RAM:** 64 GB  
- **Radio:** 2× USRP B210 + GPSDO (10 MHz external clock)  
- **OS:** Ubuntu 22.04 LTS  

---

### 🧩 Software Stack

- **5G Stack:** [`srsRAN`](https://github.com/srsran/srsRAN) + [`open5GS`](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs)  
- **Languages:** C / C++ (core), Python (test & automation)  
- **Crypto Libraries:**  
  - [`OpenSSL`](https://www.openssl.org/) — ECC & hash primitives  
  - [`liboqs`](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs) — PQC baseline (comparison)  
  - [`GMP`](https://gmplib.org/) & [`PBC`](https://crypto.stanford.edu/pbc/) — pairing & finite-field arithmetic  
- **Parallelization:** OpenMP / AVX2 vectorization for multi-signer operations

## 📊 Performance Highlights

| Scheme | Comm. Overhead (Bytes) | E2E Delay (ms) | Security Features |
|:--------|:-----------------------:|:---------------:|:------------------|
| ML-DSA (PQC) | 12276 | 5282 | PQ-secure only |
| Schnorr-HIBS | 144 | 1.61 | Classical IBS |
| **BORG (t,n = 2,3)** | **144** | **2.99** | PQ fail-stop + threshold + distributed trust |

> 🧩 *BORG maintains 5G-compatible packet sizes (≤ 372 B) while achieving PQ-aware forgery detection and distributed authentication.*

## 🧪 Experimental Testbed

**Setup:**  
- 5G UE ↔ BS over srsRAN (USRP B210)  
- AMF & Core via open5GS  
- Cold-storage logs maintained on distributed BS nodes  

**Results:**  
- ⚡ 85× lower comm. overhead than NIST PQC  
- ⚡ Up to 1767× faster than ML-DSA  
- 📶 Seamless integration with unmodified 5G SIB1 flow
